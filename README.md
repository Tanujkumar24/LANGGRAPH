# README for Pre-Requisite Assistant RAG LCEL Notebook

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook implements a comprehensive workflow for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system leveraging LangChain and related tools. It integrates multiple models and utilities for efficient data processing, document loading, vector storage, and intelligent query handling. The notebook is structured into 41 code cells and 3 markdown cells, facilitating a seamless setup and execution process.

## Workflow

### 1. **Environment Setup**
   - The notebook uses the `dotenv` library to manage environment variables, ensuring secure and streamlined configuration.
   - Key modules such as `langchain` and `langchain_community` are imported to build and extend functionality.

### 2. **Data Loading**
   - Utilizes document loaders from `langchain_community.document_loaders` to ingest various data formats.
   - Implements text splitting techniques for efficient chunking of large documents using `langchain.text_splitter`.

### 3. **Vector Store Integration**
   - Employs `langchain_community.vectorstores` for indexing and querying documents.
   - Vector search capabilities enable semantic retrieval of information.

### 4. **Agent and Toolchain**
   - `langchain.agents` is used to define and orchestrate multi-step workflows.
   - Custom tools from `langchain_community.tools` and `langchain_community.utilities` enhance functionality, including search and utility operations.

### 5. **Multi-Model Usage**
   - The notebook integrates multiple models to achieve RAG capabilities:
     - **LangChain Core Models**: For foundational operations such as document processing and querying.
     - **Google GenAI**: Leveraged for advanced generative capabilities.
     - **Custom Tools**: Community tools augment the standard model capabilities for domain-specific tasks.

### 6. **Execution and Output**
   - Executes a series of tasks to demonstrate retrieval and augmented generation.
   - Outputs include logs and generated text responses.

## Outputs

### Key Results
The notebook generates 4 key textual outputs during execution, providing insights or answers to queries. No visualizations or error logs were detected during analysis, indicating smooth operation.

## Prerequisites

1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure `.env` file is configured with necessary keys (e.g., API keys).
2. **Python Libraries**:
   - Install required libraries: `langchain`, `dotenv`, `os`, and community modules.
   - Use `pip install` or a requirements file to streamline setup.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the notebook directory.
2. Install dependencies using the provided `requirements.txt` (if available) or manually.
3. Execute the notebook step-by-step, following the cell order.
4. Review outputs in the respective code cells for results.

## Libraries and Tools Used

- **LangChain Ecosystem**:
  - `langchain`
  - `langchain_community`
- **Google GenAI Integration**:
  - `langchain_google_genai`
- **Environment Management**:
  - `dotenv`
- **System Utilities**:
  - `os`

## Notes

- Ensure you have the necessary API access for external tools.
- Customize document loaders and vector store configurations to fit your data.
